# RTKBase
From c. 2011 I began creating solutions for survey and hydrography. 
This repo is a rewrite from 2023, with a spec for the simplest RTK Base configuration I can envisage.
It uses str2str from RTKLIB and Linux shell scripts.
It is intended for use with a Raspberry Pi, either at a remote site by a surveyed-in base, or at a fixed, permanent site.
